# Weather App

A very simple Weather App that shows cities and its daily weather data that I originally created on 2021.

Requirements:

- Show cities that are available on the API.
- Sort cities alphabetically.
- Refresh data that is on the home screen. (Not finished)
- Click on the city and see the weather result on a separate screen.
- Display all the temperatures in Celsius.
- Display the temperatures in a chronological order.
- Make the app offline-first.
- Optimize app for mobiles and portrait mode.
