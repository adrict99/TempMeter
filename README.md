# Weather App

A Weather App that shows cities and its daily weather data.

Application architecture: MVVM + Clean architecture.

This architecture is a good choice for android app development as it allows for a better organization of the code, a cleaner separation of concerns, and better performance.

Requirements:

- Show cities that are available on the API.
- Sort cities alphabetically.
- Refresh data that is on the home screen. (Not finished)
- Click on the city and see the weather result on a separate screen.
- Display all the temperatures in Celsius.
- Display the temperatures in a chronological order.
- Make the app offline-first.
- Optimize app for mobiles and portrait mode.

Not finished:
- Refresh data that is on the home screen:
Due to time constraints, I had to create a data caching solution not compatible with pull-to-refresh even if the animation is implemented it is not working.
- Tests. (Not created due to lack of time)

Improvements:
- Given enough time, there are many things that could be improved in a more clean way and tests could be implemented but I decided to make it like this to have a balance between features implemented while maintaining the code quality.
